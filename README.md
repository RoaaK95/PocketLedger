# PocketLedger
Offline-first Expense Tracker built with Expo, Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and SQLite

PocketLedger is a cross-platform mobile app (iOS/Android) that helps users track their daily expenses and income — even without an internet connection.
All data is stored locally using SQLite, then automatically synchronized with Firebase Firestore once the user returns online.
